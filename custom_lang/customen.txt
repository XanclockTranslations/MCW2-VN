$internationalrelationstooltiptitle=International Relations

$relationtooltiptitle=Relations
$relationtooltiptexte=the relation score spans 9 levels, from "execrable" to "exceptional." \nLosing or gaining a relation level alters the prestige score. The higher the relationship, the greater the bonus to diplomatic actions. \nYou cannot invade a country unless you have execrable relations with it.

Trade_Agreement=Trade Agreement
$tradeagreementstooltiptext=Signing a trade agreement with a country increases the prestige score. \n\nTrade agreements provide bonuses to the "economic aid" action. \n\nNo, signing trade agreements does not directly increase the budget of the CIA, the KGB or the Army; this action will have no impact on your budget.

Defence_Treaty=Defence treaty
$defencetreatiestooltiptext=Signing a defense treaty with a country increases the prestige score. \n\nA country with a defense agreement with you is considered a member of your political bloc: no other player will be able to sign a defense agreement with this country. \n\nDefense treaties provide bonuses to the "military aid" action and unlock additional actions like "military bases" and the possibility to send troops in the country.

Opposition=Opposition
$oppositiontooltiptitle=Oppositions

$embargoestooltiptext=Embargoes impose penalties on Military and Economic Aid actions. \nOver the long term, they can affect a country's stability and economic development.

Menacer=Threaten
$menacertooltiptext=Threatening a country will significantly deteriorate your relationship (recall that a decrease in relationship level results in the loss of prestige points). \n\nThis action is beneficial if you aim to invade a country, as a player can only invade countries with which they have the lowest level of relationship. \n\nThreats may also "Finlandize" a country, effectively preventing your opponent from drawing that country into their bloc.

Instructeurs=Military advisors
$instructeurstooltiptexts=Military advisors enhance the country's capability to fight wars and guerrillas.\nMilitary advisors will also train the country's army in the use of new weapons, thereby granting a bonus to the military aid action.\nSending military advisors will not trigger a nuclear showdown.\nAdvisors have an upkeep cost.


Military_Aid=Military aid
$militaryaidtooltiptext=This action will directly bolster the country's armed forces.\n\nThe army score of a country considers not only the weaponry but also the training, maintenance, supply chain, and more. \n\nHence, the presence of your military advisors, military bases, and defense agreements all positively influence this metric.

Mercenaires=Mercenaries
$mercenariestooltiptext=Mercenaries will fight on behalf of the government. \n\nThis is a method to strengthen a country without directly involving your own military. \n\nHowever, if this action is utilized too frequently, its cost will quickly increase. \n\nIt's important to remember that mercenaries might have their own agendas, potentially leading to complications such as staging coups, seizing local resources, or brutalizing the population.

Manifestations=Demonstrations
$manifestationstooltiptexts=This action is used to reduce a country's stability.\n\nDemocracies and authoritarian regimes will respond to protests in very different ways: the outcomes of such actions can vary widely, and the stability of a country may even be strengthened, depending on the government's response.

$spheresandblocstooltiptitle=Blocs and Spheres of Influence

$spheretooltiptitle=Sphere of Influence
$spheretooltiptexts=This indicates that the country is of special interest to a power and within its traditional sphere of influence. \nPrestige point gains and losses for a country in a player's sphere of influence are doubled. \nAdditionally, a power receives a bonus in the event of a nuclear showdown if the country is within its sphere of influence.

$blocstooltiptitile=Blocs
$blocstooltiptitxte=A country which signed a defence treaty with a player enters its political bloc.\nOther players won't be able to signe defence agreements with that country.

$guerillastooltiptitle=Guerillas
$guerillastooltiptexte=To interact with a guerilla, just click on its flag to display possibe actions.\n\nMost guerillas will try to overthrow the government, but some will simply carve their territory in an easy to defend area and exploit local resources.\n\nGuerillas will also interact with other guerillas, to fight or cooperate.

Economic_Aid=Economic Aid
$aideEcoWiki=Economic aid is an action primarily aimed at enhancing your relationship with a country.\n\n While it can also contribute to increasing its stability and developing its economy over time, these are considered secondary outcomes.\n\nHowever, channeling excessive aid into a fragile country may elevate its corruption level. Therefore, it's prudent to act judiciously to prevent adverse impacts on the local economy.\n\nThis action tends to be more effective if you have a trade agreement with the recipient country.

$middlemouseclicktoinspect=\n\n(Clicking on the middle mouse button allows you to inspect the algorithm behind that action.)

Coup=Coup
$couptooltiptext=Coups are executed to change the government, installing a strongman in power with military backing.\n\nContrary to initial assumptions players might have, this action is primarily intended for use on allies. \n\nStrong ties with the local military are crucial for planning a successful coup: the presence of military bases, advisors, and defense agreements all provide bonuses to this action. \n\nIt is advisable to employ this strategy on low-stability allied countries that you fear losing.

Create_Guerilla=Create guerilla
$createguerillatooltiptext=Inspiring and financing a guerrilla movement is not the quickest path to power, but it is effective and will compel your opponent to allocate resources to defend the country.\n\nThe characteristics of guerrillas are heavily shaped by the socio-political and cultural background of the country where they operate.\n\nIf a guerrilla movement succeeds in overthrowing the government, it will establish a new government that is friendly to you.

Stay_behind=Stay Behind
$staybehindtooltiptexts=Stay behind groups are underground groups created to conduce secret sabotage and guerilla operations should this country fell under communist rule.\n\nThey can also be activated to conduce a "strategy of tension": opening a period marked by internal conflict, terrorism, and political manipulation, aimed at creating a state of fear and division within the population, often to justify authoritarian measures by the state or to discredit political opponents.

Invade=Invade
Send_troops=Send troops
$sendtroopsinfobulletext=Troops will be deployed to defend a country if there is a defense treaty in place, or to invade it if relations are execrable.\n\nDeploying troops incurs an upkeep cost of $1 per troop point.\n\nSending and withdrawing troops sends a strong signal to other countries. \nThreatening the interests of other players may even trigger a nuclear showdown.

Withdraw_troops_all=Withdraw troops (all)
Withdraw_troops=Withdraw troops
$withdrawtroopsinfobulletext=Deployed troops incur an upkeep cost of $1 per troop, so withdrawing them will positively impact your budget.\n\nHowever, this action may be perceived as a sign of weakness by your opponent, so carefully consider your decision.

Bombardement=Bombing
$bombinginfobulletext=Will destroy the target country's infrastructure, reducing its wealth and stability. \n\nUnderdeveloped countries are more resilient to strategic bombing.\n\nBombing campaigns may also impact the country's military forces and can result in significant destruction if the country has steppe or desert terrains.

Napalm=Napalm
$napalminfobulletext=Napalm is the ideal method for dislodging guerrillas entrenched in jungles or in otherwise inaccessible hideouts.\nBe prepared for some backlash in terms of prestige as your population discovers the use of such controversial weapons.

activerstaybehind=Activate Stay Behind
activerstaybehindinfobulletexte=Activating the stay-behind groups is politically irresponsible. It will open a period marked by internal conflict, terrorism, and political manipulation aimed at creating a state of fear and division within the population. This is often done to justify authoritarian measures by the state or to discredit political opponents.

financerguerilla=Finance the guerrilla
financerguerillainfobulletexte=This action will directly increase the strength of the guerrilla, and it will likely improve your relationship with this group, provided it is not politically too distant from you. You can expect diplomatic consequences from neighboring countries.

infiltrerguerilla=Infiltrate guerrilla
infiltrerguerillainfobulletexte=This action will unlock other actions to influence this guerilla.

poussernegociation=Encourage to negotiate
poussernegociationinfobulletexte=In case of success, the guerrilla will open negotiations with the government. \nHowever, it is a long road before it lays down its arms. \nDuring the negotiations, one can expect a truce in the fighting.

Wesaidnodrugs=We said no drug in the operation room!
Wesaidnodrugsdetails=As the searing light envelops me, my body begins to dissolve, atom by atom, in the relentless energy of the thermonuclear explosion. \nThe pain, surprisingly, is fleeting—a mere whisper compared to the overwhelming surge of liberation that follows. \nI feel every boundary of my physical form disintegrating, my very essence merging with the universe. \nIn these final moments, there's an unexpected clarity, a profound enlightenment that dawns within the chaos. \nTime stretches infinitely, each second blooming into eternity. \nAs I transcend the mortal coil, the universe unfolds before me in all its unfathomable glory. \nHere, in this ultimate dissolution, I find an exquisite peace, connecting to a cosmic symphony that resonates through what was once me. \nThis is not the end, but a sublime beginning, a transcendence into a state where I am both nothing and everything—boundless and free.

ManyAgesLater=Many ages later...
chimpanzeeconference=[b]Lord Bono, dean of Arkhan University[/b]: (speaking to a gathering of fellow intelligent species)\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen of the council, today I address a topic of great mystery and misunderstanding: the long-ago disappearance of the mythical human race. It has been speculated by many that such a demise could have been wrought by a catastrophic nuclear war. But let us consider this logically, shall we?"\n\n(pauses and adjusts his goggles thoughtfully)\n"The humans, according to our archaeological reconstructions, were a species of considerable technological advancement. They crafted devices that could explore the depths of space and the intricacies of their own DNA. \nCould a civilization capable of such feats truly have been so stupid as to annihilate themselves with their own creations?"\n\n(murmurs of agreement and curiosity ripple through the audience)\n"I posit that this is highly unlikely. \nWe must look beyond simple explanations and consider more complex scenarios. Perhaps they ascended to a different plane of existence altogether."\n\n(gestures emphatically with a furry hand)\n"Let us not reduce their story to one of mere folly and destruction. \nThe humans were far more sophisticated than such a narrative would suggest. We must learn not only what happened to them but also what they can teach us about the evolution and potential pitfalls of civilization."

$chinedienbienphuTitle=Chinese "Brotherly Volunteers" in Vietnam!
$chinedienbienphudetail=The air raid is over, but the relief proves fleeting for the French.\n\nSensing an opportunity, Beijing escalates—sending waves of "volunteers" southward, transforming Vietnam into a proxy battleground.\nThe French Expeditionary Corps, stranded and undersupplied, becomes the focal point of a larger conflict, caught between a surging Việt Minh and direct Chinese intervention.\n\nThe war widens, and the stakes spiral beyond control.

$titrePolishOctober=Polish October
$textePolishOctober=Public protests and destalinization led the USSR to accept a more liberal line in this country. \nThat change first happened in Poland, where Gomułka's nationalist reformer faction conduced (a short lived) liberalisation and the effective end of Stalinism in Poland. In the game, a country with this trait protected from the effects of high Stalinism scores, but is more vulnerable to low stalinism efects.\n'Align' action has less chances of success but may remove that trait.

description_thaw_long=Will the death of Stalin and the rise of Khrushchev mark the beginning of a Détente era between the two blocs? The decision is up to you!\n\nWhile the USSR faces its first major contestations in the people's republics of Eastern Europe, a new world emerges and refuses to be aligned with any of the blocs. \nIn this global duel, no direct conflict is possible. \nThis is a Cold War for the world leadership, made of propagande and subversion, that begins.

unleptmoonpromize=MOONSHOT DREAM DIMS
unleptmoonpromizetext=In January 1970, the dream of landing on the Moon feels like a distant memory.\nKennedy's promise, once a rallying cry for a generation, has faded into the background. \nWith the space race stalling, the public's attention has shifted elsewhere.\nCivil rights movements continue to challenge the status quo, and the American people are more focused on the turmoil at home than the stars. \nThe Moon remains out of reach, and the promise of exploration is buried under the weight of everyday struggles.\n\n-->USA loses 500 prestige

moondreamcometrue=A DREAM COME TRUE
moondreamcometruedetail=On this day, America’s boldest promise was realized as Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. \nKennedy's vision of putting a man on the lunar surface by the end of the decade became a triumphant symbol of American innovation and resolve. \nThe world watched in awe as Neil Armstrong took his famous first step, cementing the U.S. as a leader in space exploration. \nThe achievement ignited a sense of national pride and inspired generations to come, fulfilling a dream that seemed impossible just a few short years earlier.\n\n-->The USA gains an additional 500 prestige bonus for fulfilling the president's promise.

Revolutionarymagnet=REVOLUTIONARY BEACON
Revolutionarymagnettext=Young idealists and students are flocking to Havana from every corner of South and Central America to be part of the Revolution. \nThe Revolution is something new in Cuba: a whole new class of revolutionary administrators is emerging. \nThey are young, and they are men and women in a hurry. \nAmong them are many rising stars, including Ernesto "Che" Guevara, Camilo Cienfuegos and Fidel Castro. \nNeedless to say, U.S. stakes in Cuba are threatened by Communist reforms, and it is doubtful that Washington will cut its losses without a strong reaction.\n\n-->Cuban relations with USA: -2\n-->Cuban stability +1
