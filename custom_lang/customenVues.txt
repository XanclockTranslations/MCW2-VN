// Display INFO about traits

$titretraits=Details of the Traits
$titreterrain=Terrain
$texteterrain=If the terrain is jungle or mountain, fighting guerrilla groups will be more difficult, and the country will defend itself better against invaders. The guerrilla groups that appear in these countries have a higher chance to spawn with certain Traits like \"Rural guerrilla\" or \"Sanctuary\"

$titrefinlandisation=Finlandisation
$textefinlandisation=This country is in a situation of imposed neutrality (like Finland after WW2): it cannot sign defence agreements.

$titrenonalignement=Non-aligned
$textenonalignement=This country refuses to enter the logic of a bipolar world and distrusts both the USA and the USSR. Signing defence agreements with it is possible, but it is extremely difficult (in short, this trait is a less restrictive version of the Neutral Trait. \nA neutral country can also be Non-aligned, showing a strong will to retain its absolute independence.

$titreneutralite=Neutral
$texteneutralite=This country will not sign defence agreements under any circumstances! It will also try to avoid appearing too close to one of the two blocs.

$titrepayscorrompu=Corruption
$textepayscorrompu=This Trait is a true nightmare. Economic aid actions are less efficient in developing and stabilising corrupted countries, but are more efficient at improving relations with their government. Corruption plagues the entire social body and generates discontent; it is thus easier to destabilise a corrupted country. This Trait might disappear if the regime changes... but that is unlikely. 

$titrepuissancenucleaire=Nuclear bomb
$textepuissancenucleaire=Whether officially or in a secret manner, this country owns nuclear weapons. The nuclear arsenal of this country is quite modest when compared to those of the superpowers. However, a single atomic bomb on Moscow or Washington is all that it takes to force you to think twice -- this country cannot be invaded anymore!

$titrepaystribal=Tribalism
$textepaystribal=This country is comprised of several ethnic, tribal, linguistic, or religious groups.An ill-intentioned global power or irresponsible politicians can take advantage of this characteristic to provoke armed conflicts. Actions to create a guerrilla are easier in these countries, but encouraging violence can result in an endless cycle...


$titreparanoiaque=Paranoia
$texteparanoiaque=The government is so paranoid that creating an opposition or destabilising this country will be almost impossible.

$titreong=NGOs
$texteong=NGOs are operating in this country, and are very active there. They notably increase the effect of economic aid. They can warn the world about massacres and crimes against humanity in the countries where they operate -- possibly disturbing anti-guerrilla operations as a result.

$titreonu=Blue Berets
$texteonu=A contingent of Blue Berets has been deployed in this country. Its presence hampers the ongoing military operations in the country... until the fighting parties decide they are interesting targets. 

$titresinai=Occupation of the Sinai
$textesinai=The Israeli army occupies part of Egyptian national territory. Egypt is actively preparing its revenge. A new war will likely break out when the Egyptian armed forces are sufficiently prepared. If the Golan Heights are occupied as well, the Syrians will likely join the conflict.


$titregolan=Occupation of the Golan Heights
$textegolan=The Israeli army occupies part of Syrian national territory. Syria is actively preparing its revenge. A new war will likely break out when the Syrian armed forces are sufficiently prepared. If the Sinai is occupied as well, the Egyptians will likely join the conflict.


$titreideologies=Ideologies
$ideologiescommentaire=These ideologies are necessarily those embraced by the existing government, but they also have a significant weight in the political and intellectual life of this country.

$titrebaasisme=Ba'athism
$textebaasisme=Ba'athism is a secular Arab renaissance school of thought that combines Arab socialism and Pan-Arabism. Ba'athism is very critical toward both Marxism and Western imperialism. It is a serious ideological alternative that generates a disadvantage (-1) to the creation of oppositions.

$titrefreresmusulmans=Muslim Brotherhood
$textefreresmusulmans=The ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood is well-rooted in this country. This movement advocates an Islamic rebirth. Born in the 1920s, this school of thought spread across the Islamic world, where it is a staunch opponent of secular governments.

This tendency led to the creation of an International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in 1949.

$demochretiennetitle=The US has a bonus to its aligment actions

$titredemochretienne=Christian democracy

$textedemochretienne=Christian democracy draws its inspiration from the values of Christian humanism.
