// Display INFO about traits

titretraits=Details of the Traits
titreterrain=Terrain
texteterrain=If the terrain is jungle or mountain, fighting guerrilla groups will be more difficult, and the country will defend itself better against invaders. The guerrilla groups that appear in these countries have a higher chance to spawn with certain Traits like "Rural guerrilla" or "Sanctuary"

titrefinlandisation=Finlandisation
textefinlandisation=This country is in a situation of imposed neutrality (like Finland after WW2): it cannot sign defence agreements.

titrenonalignement=Non-aligned
textenonalignement=This country refuses to enter the logic of a bipolar world and distrusts both the USA and the USSR. Signing defence agreements with it is possible, but it is extremely difficult (in short, this trait is a less restrictive version of the "Neutral" Trait. A neutral country can also be Non-aligned, showing a strong will to retain its absolute independence.

titreneutralite=Neutral
texteneutralite=This country will not sign defence agreements under any circumstances! It will also try to avoid appearing too close to one of the two blocs.

titrepayscorrompu=Corruption
textepayscorrompu=This Trait is a true nightmare. Economic aid actions are less efficient in developing and stabilising corrupted countries, but are more efficient at improving relations with their government. Corruption plagues the entire social body and generates discontent it is thus easier to destabilise a corrupted country. This Trait might disappear if the regime changes... but that is unlikely. 

titrepuissancenucleaire=Nuclear bomb
textepuissancenucleaire=Whether officially or in a secret manner, this country owns nuclear weapons. The nuclear arsenal of this country is quite modest when compared to those of the superpowers. However, a single atomic bomb on Moscow or Washington is all that it takes to force you to think twice -- this country cannot be invaded anymore!

titrepaystribal=Tribalism

textepaystribal=This country is comprised of several ethnic, tribal, linguistic, or religious groups.
An ill-intentioned global power or irresponsible politicians can take advantage of this characteristic to provoke armed conflicts. Actions to create a guerrilla are easier in these countries, but encouraging violence can result in an endless cycle...


titreparanoiaque=Paranoia
texteparanoiaque=The government is so paranoid that creating an opposition or destabilising this country will be almost impossible.

titreong=NGO
texteong=NGOs are actively operating in this area. They notably increase the effect of economic aid. They can warn the world about massacres and crimes against humanity in the countries where they operate -- possibly disturbing anti-guerrilla operations as a result.

titreonu=Blue Berets
texteonu=A contingent of Blue Berets has been deployed in this country. Its presence hampers the ongoing military operations in the country... until the fighting parties decide they are interesting targets. 

titresinai=Occupation of the Sinai

textesinai=The Israeli army occupies part of Egyptian national territory. Egypt is actively preparing its revenge. A new war will likely break out when the Egyptian armed forces are sufficiently prepared. If the Golan Heights are occupied as well, the Syrians will likely join the conflict.

titregolan=Occupation of the Golan Heights

textegolan=The Israeli army occupies part of Syrian national territory. Syria is actively preparing its revenge. A new war will likely break out when the Syrian armed forces are sufficiently prepared. If the Sinai is occupied as well, the Egyptians will likely join the conflict.

titrebaasisme=Baathism
textebaasisme=Baathism is a secular Arab renaissance school of thought that combines Arab socialism and Pan-Arabism. Baathism is very critical toward both Marxism and Western imperialism. It is a serious ideological alternative that generates a disadvantage (-1) to the creation of oppositions.

titrefreresmusulmans=Muslim Brotherhood
textefreresmusulmans=The ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood is well-rooted in this country. This movement advocates an Islamic rebirth. Born in the 1920s, this school of thought spread across the Islamic world, where it is a staunch opponent of secular governments. This is a serious ideological alternative to liberalism and Marxism, resulting in a disadvantage (-1) to the creation of oppositions.

titreislamrigoriste=Fundamentalist Islam

texteislamrigoriste=This catch-all category hosts schools of thought, such as Wahhabism or Salafism, that push for a return to the origins of the Islamic faith.
These ideologies do not get along with Marxism and political liberalism, resulting in a disadvantage (-1) to the creation of oppositions.


titrenasserisme=Nasserism

textenasserisme=The nationalist and Pan-Arab ideals of Gamal Abdel Nasser fired the imagination of the Arab world. Nasser envisioned a world where Arab nations could oppose the former colonial powers and work together against Israel. This is a serious ideological alternative to liberalism and Marxism, resulting in a disadvantage (-1) to the creation of oppositions.


titretheologieliberation=Liberation theology

textetheologieliberation=Beginning with Marxist statements and analysis, a theological school of thought emerged with a view of restoring dignity to the poor. This is a theology of action which agitates Latin American societies, and Washington considers this a serious threat.

titrepolitique=Socio-political information

titrerepublique=Republic

Disadvantage to creating opppositions: 2<br>
Disadvantage to organising protest marches: 2

titredictature=Dictatorship

textedictature=This is the default regime type set by the US when they overthrow a government. Dictatorships are fairly resilient to subversion actions, and can even use these opportunites to destroy their opponents (crushing the oppositions you control in the process).<br>

Disadvantage to creating guerrillas: 2<br>
Disadvantage to organising protest marches: 2<br>
Disadvantage to coup actions: 2

titrereppop=Peoples republic

Disadvantage to creating guerrillas: 4<br>
Disadvantage to organising protest marches: 4<br>
Disadvantage to coup actions: 4<br>

titreetatislamique=Islamic State

texteetatislamique=This regime type believes that you are the Great Satan himself, and regurlarly reminds you that they will not do business with their archenemies -- and that does not help another nation with keeping good diplomatic relations.<br>
Disadvantage to creating opppositions: 4<br>
Disadvantage to signing defence agreements: 2<br>
Disadvantage to signing economic treaties: 2<br>
Disadvantage to relations improvement via economic aid: 2<br>

textestabilite=
The higher a countrys stability is, the stronger it will be:<br>
- Its troops will fight more effectively<br>
- It will be more resistant to subversion actions<br>
- Economic aid will be more efficient<br>
When stability hits \chaos\, the government can fall at any time.
However, a country with exceptional stability will feel so strong that it will be less inclined to sign defence agreements with a player (why would you need a protector when you are already powerful?)<br>

titrerichesse=Wealth

texterichesse=
represents the level of economic development in the country. The poorer a country is, the more sensitive it is to your economic aid. The level of wealth also impacts the Traits of the guerrilla groups that are created in a country.<br>

titreeconomie=Economy

texteeconomie=
Whether a national economy is market-based or collectivist, it is always affected by economic aid. However, collectivist economies benefit less from economic aid than their market counterparts.

creerstaybehind=Stay Behind
titlecreerstaybehind=Create a secret army that will become active in case of a Communist regime

guerillastaybehind=Stay Behind

guerillastaybehinddetail=This guerrilla group is a secret army trained in underground warfare.<br>
Its mission is to collect intelligence on Communist activities, engage in sabotage, and develop partisan networks.

This tendency led to the creation of an International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in 1949. Strongly influenced by American secret services at first, over time this movement will progressively become more independent and critical toward American policy. Divisions among the member trade unions generate a disadvantage for the USSR when it comes to organising protest marches.

demochretienne=Christian democracy
demochretiennetitle=The US has a bonus to its aligment actions

titredemochretienne=Christian democracy
textedemochretienne=Christian democracy draws its inspiration from the values of Christian humanism. Since the end of WW2, Christian democracy has had a central role in the political life of many European countries. The fear of Communism and the weakening of traditional right-wing parties (a side effect of the war) provided a fertile ground for its political growth and stability. Communism and its perceived daemons made these parties strongly Atlanticist. The US has a large bonus to its Aligning actions in countries where this ideology is present.
