General de Gaulle has even allowed the return of Maurice Thorez, the Communist leader who took refuge in Moscow during World War II, despite the fact that he could have been sentenced to death for desertion. The PCF and the Provisional Government struck a win-win deal — Communist participation in government and the return of Thorez from the USSR, in exchange for the disarmament of French Communist militias.\nThe party is now engaging in strategic propaganda, exaggerating its wartime contributions and the sacrifices of its militants to claim a leading role in French politics. The PCF has officially renounced its revolutionary ambitions, instead adopting a strategy of allying with the Socialist Party (SFIO) with the long-term goal of marginalizing and absorbing it. For now, however, the road to power is blocked by General de Gaulle's influence and the presence of a strong Centrist party, the MRP, in the provisional government.

This tragic slaughter was triggered by an unremarkable customs incident: the boarding and inspection of a Chinese smuggler’s ship escalated into an exchange of gunfire between French soldiers and Vietnamese civilians. \nThe incident might have remained obscure, had it not been for an order from Paris to teach the Vietnamese a lesson.\n\nWas this a deliberate attempt by the French army to force the hand of the Provisional Government in Indochina and safeguard colonial interests?

$textemars1946x=After three invasions in 70 years, our country must—once and for all—ensure that Germany can never again pose a threat. French troops are participating in the occupation of Germany, and we have developed a plan to secure control over the steel and coal production areas of the Ruhr and Saar valleys. \nThis would accelerate the reconstruction of France while preventing Germany from regaining its former power.\nHowever, our allies view this plan as a new Versailles Treaty, fearing it would recreate the very conditions that led to World War II. While we won’t be able to impose our plan outright, we could begin by isolating the Saarland with the aim of establishing a protectorate, and prolong the retention of German POWs to aid in the reconstruction of our economy.

Maurice Thorez, emboldened by this stunning victory, has immediately laid claim to the presidency of the Council of Ministers.\n\n(In reality, the PCF's actual vote share was 28.3%.)

The Socialists appear wary of their Communist counterparts' hegemonic ambitions.\nNevertheless, many within the Socialist Party still wish to maintain cordial relations with the Communists. \nIn response, Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos have embarked on a prolonged conciliation and charm offensive aimed at winning over Socialist representatives. \nWill they succeed in reassuring their natural allies?

$textemars1947o=Rationing is still in effect, and the daily bread ration has been reduced again, from 300g to 250g, due to a harsh frost that damaged crops this year. \nInflation has soared above 60%, and discontent is growing in the factories. \nA strike has just erupted at the Renault factories in Boulogne-Billancourt. Since the nationalization of these factories after the war, this strike is now our problem.\nThe PCF is playing its role as a governing party by not supporting the strike. The Confédération Générale des Travailleurs (CGT), a union controlled by the PCF, even denounces it as the work of 'a bunch of anarchist-Hitlerist-Trotskyists attempting to disrupt the factory.'\nIn times of shortages, everyone must make sacrifices. Is President Ramadier himself not working in an unheated office to set an example?

$titremars1947o1=STRIKE AT RENAULT
$textemars1947o1=The CGT has taken control of the factory and is moving to vote for a return to work; however, the factory remains paralyzed due to the influence of small, extreme-left anti-Stalinist trade unions. \nThe government is considering a military intervention, but opposition from the PCF blocks any such initiative. \nThe unrest is spreading across the country, and strikes are multiplying throughout France.

$titremars1947o2=STRIKE AT RENAULT
$textemars1947o2=The CGT has regained control of the factory and is set to vote for a return to work, but the factory remains paralyzed under the influence of small, extreme-left anti-Stalinist trade unions. Eventually, the workers agree to resume work after securing a bonus of 1,600 Francs and a comfortable advance from us. \nWith the conclusion of this episode, the PCF realizes it risks losing the support of part of its voting base.

$titremars1947p=THIS GOVERNMENT IS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR THE THREE OF US!
$textemars1947p=Everything has gone awry between President Ramadier and his communist ministers. Issues in Indochina, Madagascar, and other colonial problems are piling up, leading to criticism and systematic obstruction from the communists. \nFor the PCF, the reconstruction of the country is no longer the top priority; social strife has taken center stage, and the party is openly supporting strike movements across the nation.\nThe United States has indicated its willingness to help European economies recover rapidly, but they have made it clear that communist participation in national governments must come to an end. \nThe socialists in our government are at odds with the communists after refusing to support their candidate for the presidency of the Council of Ministers, resulting in a power dynamic that appears to favor socialist Paul Ramadier. \nIn this context, the President has decided to take action.

$titremars1947p2=THOREZ PRESIDENT!
$textemars1947p2=The communist influence and their electoral strength were simply too significant for President Ramadier to oust them from the government. By resigning from his position, he hoped that the communists would take the blame for the ongoing obstruction in the eyes of public opinion, and that a new vote would reaffirm his leadership as President of the Council, with enhanced authority.\nUnfortunately, his gamble turned out to be a losing one. \nManeuvered by his socialist comrades, who were engaged in a slow rapprochement with the communists, Ramadier failed to anticipate this shift. \nMaurice Thorez, a prominent communist leader, has now ascended to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers!

$titremars1947p1=THE COMMUNISTS OUSTED FROM THE GOVERNMENT
$textemars1947p1=This morning, during a Council session, President Ramadier presented his economic policy and outlined his plans for Indochina and Madagascar. There was a profound disagreement on all these points.\n'I note that our communist colleagues disagree with both the President of the government and the majority of the Council. \nWhat consequences do they intend to draw from this?'\nWhen the communists refused to resign, the President of the Council invoked the constitution, citing the article that allows for the dismissal of his ministers. \nIn just a few minutes, without any conflict, President Ramadier effectively dismantled the inefficient tripartite government system.

Chaotic and absurd actions and orders are following one another in complete disarray. The government has almost no visibility on what is actually being carried out.\nA crowd of reactionaries has just "liberated" General de Gaulle, and although no one knows the current whereabouts of the hero of Free France, Maurice Thorez announced on the radio that the general has defected to the fascist forces. This announcement, instead of rallying the army around the government, had the opposite effect: the units that were still undecided are now joining the mutineers en masse.


$titremars1947s2=TO ARMS, COMRADES!
$textemars1947s2=From Maurice Thorez:\n« …if the Soviet army, defending the cause of the people, the cause of socialism, were called upon to battle the aggressors on our soil, could the workers and the people of France react any differently to the Red Army than the peoples of Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and others? »\n\nIn a logical move, given the desperate situation, the President of the Council personally appealed to Stalin, "brilliant builder of socialism, the beloved leader of workers around the world," to save the legitimate government of France from fascist aggression.\nThe Vojd immediately responded by making an old DC-3 available for the Central Committee of the PCF, facilitating their swift exfiltration to Moscow.\nThis was not exactly the response the French communists had hoped for...

The SFIO and French public opinion support the plan; refusing it would jeopardize the alliance of Thorez's government with the socialists, while accepting it would provoke hostility from our Eastern communist allies.\nMolotov visited Thorez in Paris and firmly shut the door to any participation in the Marshall Plan.\nOur government has prolonged discussions by nitpicking over the details, but now we must make our choice.

$textemars1947x1=It was in Szklarska, during a secret meeting of European communist parties, that the storm broke over the heads of the PCF delegates, who were not expecting such harsh criticism.\nThe PCF’s position was lambasted by its communist allies, with their pursuit of a socialist alliance and their "parliamentary illusions" condemned. The Yugoslavs were the most outspoken: why hasn’t France made the revolution? What are the French comrades doing?\nFor the French delegate Marcel Cachin, these criticisms were unjust: had the Red Army entered Paris, the situation would have been like Yugoslavia’s. This meeting led to a strict clarification from comrade Zhdanov: "The goal of the United States is the consolidation of the world domination of American imperialism." \nThe Cold War is in full swing, and the French communists are now being instructed to leave the government and take their rightful place: in the streets, to make the Revolution!

But what if the mutineers were to seize power? One must be prepared for a backlash against the party and its leaders.\nAndré Marty, a seasoned veteran of the International Brigades, believes the time for revolution has come: the people are mobilized, some army units are favorable to the PCF (or infiltrated by its members), and the party has weapons, explosives, and communication networks hidden across France.

A multinational American force will then take over from us. \nThis intervention has been viewed diversely by international opinion: many governments deem it disproportionate. They also consider Power Pack a blatant case of interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. They also note that the situation is so confused that telling which camp is the legitimate one is difficult. \nHistory will tell whether our intervention was right or not.
